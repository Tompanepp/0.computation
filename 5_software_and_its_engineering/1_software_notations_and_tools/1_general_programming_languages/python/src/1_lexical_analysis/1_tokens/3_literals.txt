def literal:


types (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - string
    - bytes

    - string
        prefix: "r" | "u" | "R" | "U" | "f" | "F"
                    | "fr" | "Fr" | "fR" | "FR" | "rf" | "rF" | "Rf" | "RF"

        properties:
            character set: 
                - uses encoding declarations
                - defaults to UTF-8

    - bytes
        prefix: "b" | "B" | "br" | "Br" | "bR" | "BR" | "rb" | "rB" | "Rb" | "RB"
        
        properties:
            character set:
                - only ASCII
                    - overrules encoding declarations and Python UTF-8 default
    
    universal properties:
            - no space allowed between prefix and the rest of the literal
            - '\' used to escape special characters
                example: 
                    "\\" = \
                    "\\n" = \n
