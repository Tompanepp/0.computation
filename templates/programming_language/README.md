# Language

**objective**: an in-depth study of Language, its implementation and ecosystem.

## Language Details: 
  - [language specification]()
	- the syntax and semantics description
		- key topics:
			- implementations
			- lexical analysis
			- data model
				- standard type hierarchy
			- execution model
  - [language reference]()
  - [base modules index]()
  - [standard library reference]()
  	- commonly used and required features of a language
		e.g. collections
  - package management:
    - [packaging]()
    - tools:
    - structuring projects:
  - [package index]()
  - [extending and embedding]()
  - [developer contribution guide]()
  - [compiler/interpreter]()
  - memory model:
    - [computational complexity cost model]()
  - history:
	- the style of effective programs, with emphasis on idioms
	- fundamentals
		- value declaration
		- decision structures
		- iteration structures
	- algorithms and data structure implementations

## Testing:

## Use Cases:
  - [Applications for Language]()
  - Large Implementations:
  - Database Integration:
  - Web Development:

## Learning Resources:
  - [practice problems]()
  - [roadmap]()
